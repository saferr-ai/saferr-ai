# Launch of SAFERR AI Lab: Shaping the Future of Safe and Reliable AI

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of **SAFERR AI Lab** — a new research initiative at the **University of Central Florida (UCF)**, focused on advancing the **safety**, **reliability**, and **robustness** of Artificial Intelligence systems.

At a time when AI is rapidly reshaping industries, economies, and daily life, our mission is to ensure these systems are built with the highest standards of **trustworthiness and accountability**. SAFERR (Safety and Fairness for Reliable and Responsible AI) aims to become a global leader in AI research that upholds human values, social good, and scientific rigor.

---

## 🧠 Our Vision

We believe that safe and reliable AI is not just a technical challenge — it is a **societal imperative**.

Our vision is to develop AI systems that:

- Behave **robustly** even in adversarial or unforeseen conditions
- Operate **reliably** across diverse environments and user populations
- Comply with **ethical** and **policy frameworks**
- Foster **public trust** through transparency and interpretability

---

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

The SAFERR AI Lab works at the intersection of **theory**, **engineering**, and **ethics**. Our key research areas include:

- **Adversarial Robustness**: Building models that withstand malicious inputs and distribution shifts
- **Formal Verification of AI**: Applying formal methods to validate neural network behavior
- **Safe Reinforcement Learning**: Ensuring exploration strategies respect safety constraints
- **AI Alignment**: Aligning models with human goals and avoiding unintended behavior
- **Causal and Fair Learning**: Designing algorithms that promote fairness, explainability, and accountability
- **Policy-Aware AI Systems**: Bridging the gap between technical development and public policy

---

## 🌐 Our Institutional Home

SAFERR AI Lab is based in the **Department of Computer Science** at the University of Central Florida, and operates in collaboration with:

- [**Ethics in Technology Center**](https://ethics.ucf.edu/): Addressing the societal and ethical implications of emerging technologies
- [**Policy Research Institute**](https://policy.ucf.edu/): Grounding technical advances in real-world legal and policy considerations

These partnerships reflect our commitment to **interdisciplinary research** that considers AI's broader impact on society.

---

## 👥 Our Team

Led by **Dr. Amrit Singh Bedi**, the lab brings together a growing team of researchers, PhD students, engineers, and policy experts with backgrounds in:

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Human-Centered AI
- Science, Technology, and Society (STS)

We value diversity, intellectual curiosity, and an open collaborative culture.
